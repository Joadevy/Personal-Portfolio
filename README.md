## Overview
This is my personal portfolio initially created to success the Reponsive Web Design Certification from freecodecamp but now it's my web-page and contain personal information and a little view of my best projects.

## My process
I chose to create my portfolio with a scalability perspective so as to update it easily by putting my future projects on it. I thought about all the design and I picked a minimalist style with my personal touch. It was great and I felt comfortable with the making-process.

### Built with

- Desktop first workflow
- Responsive design
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SASS for nesting, module and custom properties
- Control version system using Git

### What I learned

This initially was my final project for the freecodecamp certifaction. I started with an idea and I was be able to get it. I like the "final" result (The project will evolve with my way to become a frontend dev and has little things that I would like to improve in future with new knowledge that I'll adquire)
I used SASS to nesting and partials in order to module my code. I used a pattern to organize the project like an architecture but adapted for this small web.
Also I learned more about web design. Then I used git in order to handle the versions of the project.
I'll keep working on it!
